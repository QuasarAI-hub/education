### Restaking Calculator
```javascript
Example compound interest calculation:
Initial Stake: 100 ATOM
APR: 15%
Compounding: Daily
1 Year Return: ~16.18% (vs 15% without compounding)
```

## Restake Mathematics 📊

### Compound Interest Formula
```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
Where:
A = Final amount
P = Principal (initial stake)
r = Annual interest rate
n = Number of times compounded per year
t = Time in years
```

### Example Returns
| Initial Stake | APR | Compound Frequency | 1 Year Return |
|--------------|-----|-------------------|---------------|
| 100 ATOM     | 15% | Daily            | 116.18 ATOM   |
| 100 ATOM     | 15% | Weekly           | 116.05 ATOM   |
| 100 ATOM     | 15% | Monthly          | 115.87 ATOM   |
