## What is Staking? üåü

### Simple Explanation
Think of staking like putting money in a savings account that helps run the network:
- You "lock" your ATOM tokens with a validator
- Your tokens help secure and operate the network
- You earn rewards (like interest) for participating
- You can unstake anytime (with a 21-day waiting period)

## Why Should You Stake? üí∞

### 1. Earn Passive Income
- Regular rewards (currently ~8-20% annual return)
- Daily reward distributions
- Compound your earnings by restaking

### 2. Support the Network
- Help secure the blockchain
- Enable faster transactions
- Support network stability
- Participate in ecosystem growth

### 3. Participate in Governance
- Vote on network changes
- Influence future development
- Have your say in important decisions
- Shape the ecosystem's future
